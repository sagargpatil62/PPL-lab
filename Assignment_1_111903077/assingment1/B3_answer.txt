'a' can take value from 4 to 100 as shown in the dump file.
a < 4 condition will never be true as the value of 'a' starts from 4 to 100, which is always greater than or equal to 4.
So, we will get always a false value each time, so the compiler knows this and it seems like it has removed the <bb 3>,
which is the conditional check (if-else block).
