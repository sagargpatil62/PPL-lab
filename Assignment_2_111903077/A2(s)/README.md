# About
This assignment is all about the study of intermediate files generated by gcc.
These files are 
```
Preprocessor output (the .i file)
Assembly Code (the .s file)
Output file (the .o file)
```
## Commands used
```
gcc --save-temps source.c
objdump -l -d -r source.o
objdump --prefix-addresses source.o
```
## Preprocessor Output
The preprocessor copies the included files, removes comments and expands the macros.

The processed output can be seen in the .i file.

## Assembly Code
The assembly Code is generated by the compiler with the preprocessed output as its input.

It contains the assembly instructions.

## Output file
The output file (.o) is a relocatable ELF file.

It is output of the assembler. It contains the Machine Code.

ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format

These files are linked by linker to produce the final output executable.

## ObjDump
The .s and .i files can be directly viewed by text editors such as gedit.

But not the .o file

In order to see the file, we use the objdump utility
